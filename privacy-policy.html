          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

          <p><strong>Last Updated: 10 December 2025</strong></p>

          <p>R13 Enterprises Pty Ltd ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner.</p>

          <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, store, and disclose personal information in compliance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).</p>

          <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
          <p>This website is operated by R13 Enterprises Pty Ltd, an Australian proprietary limited company.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>ABN:</strong> 73 684 021 172</li>
            <li><strong>Email:</strong> enquiries@r13.ai</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. What Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>We collect personal information that is reasonably necessary for us to provide our estimation and consultancy services. This includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Identity Data:</strong> Full name, business name (if applicable)</li>
            <li><strong>Contact Data:</strong> Email address and phone number</li>
            <li><strong>Project Data:</strong> Project briefs, estimation requirements, site details, technical specifications, drawings, and other information relevant to the services you are requesting</li>
            <li><strong>Communication Data:</strong> Records of our correspondence with you, including emails, phone calls, and meeting notes</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Data:</strong> Payment details, invoicing information, and transaction records</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We do not collect "sensitive information" (such as health information, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, or biometric data) unless you voluntarily provide it and it is strictly required for the specific service requested.</p>

          <h2>2A. Children's Information</h2>
          <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under 18 years of age without verifiable parental or guardian consent. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us immediately at enquiries@r13.ai so we can delete it.</p>

          <h2>3. How We Collect Information</h2>
          <p>We collect personal information directly from you when you:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Submit a request or enquiry via our website contact forms</li>
            <li>Contact us via email or telephone</li>
            <li>Provide project documentation, drawings, or specifications for estimation purposes</li>
            <li>Engage us for consultancy services</li>
            <li>Make payment for our services</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3A. Anonymity and Pseudonymity</h2>
          <p>Where practicable, we provide the option to deal with us anonymously or using a pseudonym (for example, for general enquiries). However, for the provision of our estimation and consultancy services, we require your real name and contact details to fulfill our contractual and legal obligations.</p>

          <h2>3B. Unsolicited Information</h2>
          <p>If we receive personal information we did not request (unsolicited information), we will determine within a reasonable period whether we could have collected it under the APPs. If not, and it is lawful and reasonable to do so, we will destroy or de-identify that information.</p>

          <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>We use your personal information strictly for the purpose of running our business and providing our services. Specifically, we use your data to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide estimation and consultancy services</li>
            <li>Communicate with you regarding your project, enquiry, or service delivery</li>
            <li>Process invoicing and payments</li>
            <li>Maintain business records and accounts</li>
            <li>Comply with our legal and regulatory obligations (including tax and professional standards)</li>
            <li>Improve our services and website functionality</li>
            <li>Respond to complaints or legal claims</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> We do not use your personal information for direct marketing purposes, nor do we sell or rent your personal information to third parties.</p>

          <h2>4A. Automated Decision-Making</h2>
          <p>We may use automated tools and software (including AI-assisted estimation tools) to assist with preliminary project assessments and estimations. However, all final decisions, recommendations, and deliverables are reviewed and validated by qualified professionals. You have the right to request human review of any automated assessments.</p>

          <h2>5. Disclosure of Information</h2>
          <p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties only when necessary to provide our services or fulfill our legal obligations, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Third-party technology providers who assist us in running our business (e.g., cloud storage providers, email hosting services, project management tools, accounting software)</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Advisers:</strong> Accountants, lawyers, auditors, or insurers as required for business operations</li>
            <li><strong>Contractors and Subcontractors:</strong> If we engage specialists to assist with your project (only information necessary for their role)</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Institutions:</strong> For payment processing</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Authorities:</strong> If required or authorized by law, or to protect our rights</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We do not otherwise disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent.</p>

          <h2>Cross-Border Disclosure</h2>
          <p>While R13 Enterprises is based in Australia, we use third-party service providers that may store or process data outside Australia. These may include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Cloud hosting services</strong> (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud) - primarily United States</li>
            <li><strong>Email services</strong> (e.g., Microsoft 365, Google Workspace) - United States</li>
            <li><strong>Project management and collaboration tools</strong> - various jurisdictions</li>
            <li><strong>Payment processors</strong> - various jurisdictions</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We take reasonable steps to ensure these providers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Handle data securely and in compliance with standards substantially similar to the APPs</li>
            <li>Have contractual privacy and security obligations</li>
            <li>Operate in jurisdictions with comparable privacy protections, or are bound by recognized privacy frameworks (e.g., EU-US Data Privacy Framework, APEC Cross-Border Privacy Rules)</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>By providing your personal information to us, you consent to this cross-border transfer.</strong> You may withdraw consent at any time by contacting us, though this may affect our ability to provide services to you.</p>
          <p>The countries where your data may be processed include: United States, European Union member states, Singapore, and other countries where our service providers operate data centers.</p>

          <h2>6. Storage and Security</h2>
          <p>We are committed to keeping your data secure. We utilize appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information from misuse, interference, loss, and unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure.</p>
          <p>Security measures include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Encrypted data transmission (SSL/TLS)</li>
            <li>Secure password-protected systems</li>
            <li>Access controls limiting who can view your information</li>
            <li>Regular security assessments and updates</li>
            <li>Staff training on privacy and security obligations</li>
          </ul>
          <p>However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

          <h2>6A. Data Retention</h2>
          <p>We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, or as required by law. Our typical retention periods are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Active project data:</strong> Duration of project plus 7 years (to meet tax, legal, and professional standards obligations)</li>
            <li><strong>Completed project data:</strong> 7 years from project completion</li>
            <li><strong>Enquiry data (no engagement):</strong> 2 years from last contact</li>
            <li><strong>Financial and tax records:</strong> 7 years (Australian Taxation Office requirement)</li>
            <li><strong>Legal/dispute-related records:</strong> Duration of matter plus 7 years</li>
          </ul>
          <p>After these retention periods, we will securely destroy or permanently de-identify your information, unless we are legally required to retain it for longer.</p>
          <p>You may request earlier deletion of your information, subject to our legal and contractual obligations.</p>

          <h2>6B. Data Breach Response</h2>
          <p>We have procedures in place to detect, respond to, and manage data breaches. In the event of an eligible data breach (one that is likely to result in serious harm to affected individuals), we will:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Notify affected individuals as soon as practicable</li>
            <li>Notify the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)</li>
            <li>Provide recommendations on steps you can take to mitigate potential harm</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This complies with the Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme under the Privacy Act.</p>

          <h2>7. Access and Correction</h2>
          <p>Under the Australian Privacy Principles, you have the right to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Request access</strong> to the personal information we hold about you</li>
            <li><strong>Request corrections</strong> if the information is inaccurate, incomplete, out of date, or misleading</li>
            <li><strong>Request deletion</strong> of your information (subject to legal retention requirements)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To make such a request, please contact us at enquiries@r13.ai. We will respond to your request within <strong>30 days</strong>.</p>
          <p>In some circumstances, we may refuse access where permitted by law, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Where providing access would pose a serious threat to life, health, or safety</li>
            <li>Where providing access would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of others</li>
            <li>Where the request is frivolous or vexatious</li>
            <li>Where providing access would reveal commercially sensitive information</li>
            <li>Where the information is subject to legal privilege or relates to enforcement-related activities</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If we refuse your request, we will provide you with written reasons for the refusal (unless unreasonable to do so) and inform you of complaint mechanisms available.</p>
          <p><strong>There is no fee</strong> for making an access or correction request, though we may charge a reasonable fee for providing access in complex cases (we will inform you of any fee before processing your request).</p>
